# Reactor

A java implementation of a simple app-level reactor.
Reactor is an event handling pattern.

## TODO

- write tests, including thread safety tests
- SynchronousReactor: follow DRY regarding the locking and unlocking of the observers map, maybe a generic component that serves this purpose is appropriate
