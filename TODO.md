# Reactor

Reactor library for Java

## TODO

- write tests, including thread safety tests
- SynchronousReactor: follow DRY regarding the locking and unlocking of the observers map, maybe a generic component that serves this purpose is appropriate
- JSON for payload?
- Constitue of event that indicates notification/statecarrying?
- Instead concurrent executor use concurrent executor service
- Create factory with thread pool
- Review access control and rearrange accordingly
